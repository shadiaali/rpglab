# Current Features

-   [x] **Author Account**

Users are able to sign up for a Primary Account, also referred to as an Author account or Main Account.


-   [x] **Character Creation/Aliases**

Primary users are able to create characters. These act as character aliases. Primary users are able to switch between these sub-accounts to facilitate roleplaying under different character names.


-   [x] **Customized Structure**

The platform is based on discussion forum software, the structure is customized and geared toward the world scaffold of a typical roleplaying setting. This includes areas, sub-areas, threads and posts.

-   [x] **Custom Profiles**

Profiles (also known as Character Sheets) are tied to each account. This makes keeping track of character attributes much easier.

-   [x] **Awards**

Users are able to upload and give characters awards/badges that appear on their profile page. 


## Built With:


# Planned Features
-   [x] Inbox System
Users would be able to send, view, delete messages.

-   [x] Random Events
Random Events act like writing prompts for users. These would randomly appear within parameters set by the Admin and show Globally (forum-wide), Locally (area-wide), Sub-locally (sub-area-wide) or at Thread level (thread-wide)

-   [x] Current Events
As various events are always being run in-game by players, a calendar/event system would be beneficial. Events could be inserted, and shown Globally (forum-wide), Locally (area-wide), Sub- locally (sub-area-wide) or at Thread level (thread-wide) in the areas they applied to with specified start/end times.

-   [x] Notifications
Users would receive notifications based on activity like new messages or new replies to threads.
